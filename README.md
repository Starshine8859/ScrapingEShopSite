`About This Project`
This project scrapes data from websites without using captchas.
It tracks only one product: Robin's Jean.
When a new listing appears on the monitored websites, the app sends an alert and posts a message to a Discord channel.

Supported websites:
 * eBay.com
 * Mercari.com
 * Grailed.com
 * OfferUp.com
 * Poshmark.com

Project Files:
 * ScrappingDB.py: Adds new product links to the database and sends them to Discord.
 * ScrappingDashboard.py: Displays new links from the database and triggers alerts.
